A new Flutter project.

# Summary of “NewsApp” Using Flutter, Dio, and Cubit
Introduction:
In this project, I developed a “NewsApp” that allows users to read diverse news articles. I used the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework to build the app. Additionally, I utilized the Dio library for web service interaction and Cubit for state management and theme switching.

## Key Features:
News Display: Users can view news articles from various sources.
Search Specific News: Users can search for specific news using keywords.
Theme Switching: Users can switch between light and dark themes using Cubit.
## Implementation Details:
Web Service Interaction:
I used the Dio library to fetch news articles from different sources.
Parsed the retrieved data using Dart.
## State Management:
Implemented Cubit to manage the app’s state.
Used Cubit to toggle between light and dark themes.
